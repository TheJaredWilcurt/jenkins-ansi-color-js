# jenkins-ansi-color-js

Pure Javascript implementation of ansi-color plugin for Jenkins.
Great replacement of class ansi-color plugin for jenkins with no server usage.

## Usage

1. Copy js folder to Jenkins theme location on filesystem.

2. Add content of main js file to your Jenkins theme js file.

### I looking for someone able to create classic Jenkins plugin from this
